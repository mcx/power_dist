# power_dist test protocol #

Power on with maximal capacitance and constant power load
 * Ensure proper dv/dt rise time

Proper quiescent current in shutdown

Verify current, voltage, and power measurements as reported over CAN

Max continuous current

Max peak current

Startup in short

Short while running

Turn off at max continuous load

Verify current sense and energy tracking with regen
